# General Code Standards

## Control Flow

- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for readability.

## Code Comments

- You MUST NEVER add commends without considering whether the comment is actually needed.
- When changing code, never document the old behavior or the behavior change (the reader only cares about the CURRENT state)
- NEVER add comments explaining that something is "improved", "better", "new", "enhanced", or referencing what it used to be
- If you're refactoring, remove old comments - don't add new ones explaining the refactoring

Only comment when code cannot convey the information:

- Why approach was chosen over alternatives
- Business constraints/requirements
- Non-obvious gotchas or edge cases
- Complex algorithms requiring explanation

<example type="invalid">
```ts
// Get the role for this account from the session
const role = session.accountMappings[accountId];
```
❌ Restates what code already shows clearly.
</example>

<example type="valid">
```ts
// Intentionally delay 2s - Stripe webhook arrives before DB commit completes
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
```
✅ Explains constraint impossible to know from code alone
</example>

## Error Handling

- Handle errors only at system boundaries where unexpected failures can occur (external APIs, file operations, user input)
- Do not add error handling for scenarios that cannot realistically happen
- Within application code, let errors propagate: if something shouldn't happen, an error message is valuable debugging information
- Services validate external data with Zod immediately upon receipt; let validation failures propagate as exceptions

## Designing Software

- YAGNI. The best code is no code. Don't add features we don't need right now.
- When it doesn't conflict with YAGNI, architect for extensibility and flexibility.
- We STRONGLY prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones. Readability and maintainability are PRIMARY CONCERNS, even at the cost of conciseness or performance.
- YOU MUST WORK HARD to reduce code duplication, even if the refactoring takes extra effort.
- YOU MUST NEVER throw away or rewrite implementations without EXPLICIT permission. If you're considering this, YOU MUST STOP and ask first.
- YOU MUST get Alex's explicit approval before implementing ANY backward compatibility.
